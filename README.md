# telegram-channel-history-export
This is essentially a Python telegram bot that can repost the channel content if you have previously imported the channel history. It bypasses flood control perfectly, posts just text, images with descriptions and just images. However, it cannot post multiple images in one post, which is sad. Paid subscription to gpt4 has expired and i stuck
just put py file in the path withresult.json, edit file (write ur bot_token), make sure ur bot setuped as an administrator of your channel (use @bot_father to check ur bot setup) and run!
